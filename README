As in title of this was mentioned, it contains my materials of 'database' course taught at my university in year 2009.

* Folder 'SQL practice' - contains some SQL code (During course we write in 'postgreSQL') which is solution to exercises during 'practical' part of course.
  
* Folder 'Project' - It's final application build on basis of guidelines set up during 'theorical' part of course. 

   Project must have contains: 
    * Text documentation 
    * Conceptual model
    * Entity ED (entity - data) model
    * SQL code 
    * main application

My project was nothing interesing (in sense of application, the database [what was the main issue of this project] is a little more interesting ;)), but mention worth is that it was my first 'ruby on rails' application ever I created. The version was 2.0.2.
